Neomundi-Labs — Thermodynamic AI Research

Exploring native energy-aware governance for modern AI systems.

🔬 Research Focus

Neomundi-Labs studies thermodynamic information processing and develops operational governance layers for AI models.
Our work focuses on four fundamental quantities:

ΔE — Energy cost of model transitions

C — Coherence of outputs

R — Recoverability and entropy reduction

T — Tenderness / ethical minimization of harmful gradients

These parameters form the backbone of the Law-E Framework, a scientific and engineering architecture designed to:

stabilize hallucinations,

reduce wasteful computation,

improve multimodal reasoning,

guide AI systems toward low-entropy, high-reliability states.

🧠 Law-E Framework

Official components currently documented:

Regulator-Selector — energy-aware stabilization module (POC Jan 11)

Filter-E — eurythmic information filter for noise suppression

Filter-NM — energy–coherence routing system

Chakana Grid — multimodal nervous system

Governor-E — global decision and consistency layer

ΔE Heatmap — internal energy introspection tool

The framework combines thermodynamic constraints with information theory to establish a native reliability layer for AI.
