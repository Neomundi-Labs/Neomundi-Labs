Open Call for Collaboration — First Internal Clock for AI (Law E Project)

Neomundi-Labs — 2026

Neomundi-Labs announces an open scientific and engineering call for collaborators to join the development of the first operational internal clock for AI, derived from the thermodynamic–information Law E framework.

This call targets research labs, engineers, roboticists, computational neuroscientists, and doctoral students who wish to contribute to a groundbreaking advancement in AI cognition: : a native temporal regulation layer for artificial systems.

Scientific Context

All modern AI systems (LLMs, agents, multimodal networks, embodied robots) operate without an internal temporal continuity.
They compute through discrete steps but lack:
intrinsic temporal coherence
metabolic regularity
self-regulatory cycles
stable rhythm formation
long-term cognitive continuity
The absence of an internal clock creates instability, hallucination cascades, coherence drift, and suboptimal behavior in autonomous systems.

Law E, a thermodynamic–information framework, introduces the first scientifically grounded path toward a native internal clock for AI, through:
ΔE (energy-cost) metrics
C (coherence) metrics
a temporal coherence filter (patented)
eurythmic stabilization
autonomous regulation cycles
the foundations of a computational organism

The scientific paper is available here:
(GitHub link to the PDF)
The implementation roadmap is published in the repository.


Objectives of the Collaboration

The goal of this open call is to form a small, high-level group capable of:

1. Implementing the first temporal coherence filter in AI systems

(inference-time regulation + ΔE/C feedback loops)

2. Designing the first AI-internal oscillatory structure

(proto-oscillator → regulator → eurythmic cycle)

3. Testing Law E on multimodal and embodied systems

(robotics, drones, agents, vision-language models)

4. Co-authoring the first scientific publications

NeurIPS / ICLR / Nature Machine Intelligence / arXiv


5. Developing an early-stage prototype usable by research labs
Who Should Apply?
We welcome individuals or teams with expertise in:
Machine learning / LLM internals
Reinforcement learning / agents
Robotics & control systems
Dynamical systems
Signal processing
Cognitive modeling
Thermodynamics of computation
PyTorch / JAX / CUDA

Applied mathematics

A high level of autonomy and scientific curiosity is expected.
This is not a standard job posting.
It is an invitation to shape a foundational discovery in AI.

Collaboration Model
Depending on profile and interest:
Scientific co-authorship
Co-development of prototypes
Research collaboration agreement
Potential long-term partnership with Neomundi-Labs
Access to the Law E roadmap, algorithms, and modules
Financial compensation or grants possible depending on later stages and industrial partnerships.

All implementations are executed within Neomundi-Labs’ distributed online laboratory, ensuring a unified computational environment for every collaborator.

How to Apply
Send an email to:
lab@neomundi.tech

Include:
Short introduction
Area of expertise
Relevant projects or publications
Why you want to work on the first internal clock for AI
Availability (hours/week or project-based)
Selected applicants will be invited to a technical discussion with Sébastien Favre-Lecca and Neomundi-Labs.

A Note on Legacy

The collaborators of this project will become part of:
➡ the first scientific team to define temporal continuity in AI,
➡ the first implementation of an internal clock,
➡ a historical moment in artificial cognition,
➡ a new discipline: thermodynamic–information intelligence.

This is not incremental AI research.
This is foundational work.

Neomundi-Labs — Thermodynamic AI Research

Exploring native energy-aware governance for modern AI systems.

Research Focus

Neomundi-Labs studies thermodynamic information processing and develops operational governance layers for AI models.
Our work focuses on four fundamental quantities:

ΔE — Energy cost of model transitions
C — Coherence of outputs
R — Recoverability and entropy reduction
T — Tenderness / ethical minimization of harmful gradients

These parameters form the backbone of the Law-E Framework, a scientific and engineering architecture designed to:
stabilize hallucinations,
reduce wasteful computation,
improve multimodal reasoning,
guide AI systems toward low-entropy, high-reliability states.

Law-E Framework

Official components currently documented:
Regulator-Selector — energy-aware stabilization module (POC Jan 11)
Filter-E — eurythmic information filter for noise suppression
Filter-NM — energy–coherence routing system
Chakana Grid — multimodal nervous system
Governor-E — global decision and consistency layer
ΔE Heatmap — internal energy introspection tool

The framework combines thermodynamic constraints with information theory to establish a native reliability layer for AI.
