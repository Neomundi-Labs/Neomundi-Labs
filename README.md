Neomundi-Labs — Thermodynamic AI Research

Exploring native energy-aware governance for modern AI systems.

🔬 Research Focus

Neomundi-Labs studies thermodynamic information processing and develops operational governance layers for AI models.
Our work focuses on four fundamental quantities:

ΔE — Energy cost of model transitions
C — Coherence of outputs
R — Recoverability and entropy reduction
T — Tenderness / ethical minimization of harmful gradients

These parameters form the backbone of the Law-E Framework, a scientific and engineering architecture designed to:
stabilize hallucinations,
reduce wasteful computation,
improve multimodal reasoning,
guide AI systems toward low-entropy, high-reliability states.

🧠 Law-E Framework

Official components currently documented:
Regulator-Selector — energy-aware stabilization module (POC Jan 11)
Filter-E — eurythmic information filter for noise suppression
Filter-NM — energy–coherence routing system
Chakana Grid — multimodal nervous system
Governor-E — global decision and consistency layer
ΔE Heatmap — internal energy introspection tool

The framework combines thermodynamic constraints with information theory to establish a native reliability layer for AI.
